## 1. How long did you spend on the coding test below?

* I spent approximately `13 days` to complete the project


* If I had more time to add a feature to this project it would be 
to allow them share their rankings in different category with a group of people specified by 
the user. It could be on the user's social media page(s)

## 2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language

* The latest version added I used was the new and fast way to format
strings in python. 
In my  `main.views.py` I made use of this function to format strings 
and it helped made my code cleaner and saved my time.

`f"A new thing {fav_thing.title} was added to {fav_thing.category.name} category. ",`

## 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

* This could be done by a technique called `profiling`. 
* We could create a simple python script to track the application call stack in production and check what it is doing at a set interval.
Those point could then be used to plot a graph and then you could tell where much CPU time is consumed and then figure out how to optimize.
This method of using sampling is called `statistical profiling`. 

* I have not done it alone but I have had the opportunity to be part of a team to checked performance of an application in production.
