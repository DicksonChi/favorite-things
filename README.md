## Dependencies

This project makes use of these dependencies:

* Python 3.6 - Programming language for backend development
* Django REST framework - REST API
* VueJs for the frontend development
* AWS LAMBDA and s3 bucket
* Zappa for deployment


## Test Description and Approach
This is a Single Page Application created with VueJs and consumes a REST API created with Django
to show the list of categories and the ranking of the favorite things under each categories.  

This solution can allow for usage by different users without using 
authentication but just a simple id that is saved on their browser once 
they enter the email they want to use.

* If the user has not used the application before it registers them with
that email. If they have used it before they continue with that email the
next time.

* There are default categories for every user in the system. 
    * Person
    * Place
    * Food  
* The user can add more categories if he wishes to and can also add, edit and delete
 favorites under those categories. 

* On the right side of the screen the users see the log of their actions 
performed by them on the application and the time they were performed. 

## Installation
```
$ git clone git@github.com:DicksonChi/favorite-things.git
$ cd favorite_things
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 virtualenv
$ source virtualenv/bin/activate
```


##### TO INSTALL DEPENDENCIES FOR THE BACKEND
`$ make requirements_dev`

##### TO INSTALL DEPENDENCIES FOR THE FRONTEND
`$ make install-fd`

## Running

##### TO RUN BACKEND
`$ make migrate`
 
`$ make run`
 
`$ make superuser` to create superuser


##### TO RUN FRONTEND
`$ make serve `


## Testing

`$ make test`

 *This command runs the `pytest` command and then creates coverage report when run.* 

##### cleanup after testing
`$ make clean`

 *after running the test there might be `.pyc ` or `__pycache__` files
so this command runs through all directories and cleans up.*


## Linting
##### Linting and static analysis backend
`$ make lint_backend`

*This command checks for the PEP issues with the python code and uses 
the `prospector.yml` defined conditions and using pylint to also check 
for linting issues in the python code and alerts you to conform to the standard.*

##### Linting and static analysis frontend
`$ make lint_frontend`

*The command runs the `npm run lint` command to apply linting
and fixes to your Vue.js code*


## Deployment

##### Backend Deployment
run this command

  ` $ make backend_deploy_start`

Provide default settings to your zappa_settings.json file:

```
- Name of environment - just accept the default 'dev'
- S3 bucket for deployments - just accept the default
- Zappa should automatically find the correct Django settings file so accept the default
```

Update the settings file in favorite_things/favorite_things and add zappa_django_utils in the list of apps

Go to your AWS console and create the VPC and then then the RDS and then update the zappa_settings.json file
```JSON
    "vpc_config" : {
            "SubnetIds": [ "your-subnet-1", "your-subnet-2"],
            "SecurityGroupIds": ["your-security-group"]
        },
        "environment_variables": {
            "AWS_REGION": "YOUR_AWS_REGION",
            "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "YOUR AWS SECRET KEY IN YOUR .aws/credentials FILE",
            "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "YOUR AWS KEY ID IN YOUR .aws/credentials FILE",
            "SECRET_KEY": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
            "DATABASE_URL": "psql://USER:PASS@RDS_ENDPOINT:5432/DB_NAME"
        },
```

Now run `$ make stage=YOUR_STAGE_NAME backend_deploy`
you should get this message 
  ```
  Scheduled favorite-things-dev-zappa-keep-warm-handler.keep_warm_callback with expression rate(4 minutes)!
  Deploying..
  Your application is now live at https://URI.REGION.amazonaws.com/STAGE_NAME
  ```
create a new bucket for the static folder and add this to your settings
 ```PYTHON
  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")

  AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME_STATIC = "NEW_BUCKET_NAME"
  AWS_S3_BUCKET_AUTH_STATIC = True
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "YOUR_KEY_ID"
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "YOUR SECRET KEY"
  AWS_REGION = "YOUR REGION"
  STATICFILES_STORAGE = "django_s3_storage.storage.StaticS3Storage"
  AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = "{}.s3.amazonaws.com".format(AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME_STATIC)
  STATIC_URL = "https://{}/".format(AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN)
```

Then run the command to update this deployment

   ```
     $ make stage=STAGE_NAME backend_update
   ```

Now run this command to collect static for the admin view

  ```
   $ make collectstatic
  ```

Now lets create the db. Since we already have the VPC and the RDS setup
run this command
  ```
   $ make stage=STAGE_NAME backend_create_db
   ```
*note: please replace the STAGE_NAME with the stage name you want to deploy*

If you get the error message that a db with same name exists, then ignore
 Now let us migrate, load fixtures and create admin user
```
$ make stage=STAGE_NAME backend_migrate
$ make command="loaddata fixtures/default_category.json" backend_command
$ make command="from main.models import User; User.objects.create_superuser(email='admin@ybritecore.com', password='password')" backend_command
```

##### Frontend Deployment
After deploying the backend code get the endpoint URL and update the PROD constant in constants.js file in 
`frontend/src` 

create the s3 bucket that will collect the static files for the frontend.

Go to the bucket permission and then under the cors configuration copy this code to allow for public access
  ``` XML
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
        <AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
    </CORSConfiguration>
  ```

run this command to then deploy the frontend

  `$ make bucket=s3://YOUR_BUCKET build_deploy`

Copy the url of the static bucket and access it from your browser.

Now you too can now make a list of your own favorite things!
